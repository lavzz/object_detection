# object_detection

Uses the tensorflow object-detection API to identify patches on Steel 

This was written in Tensorflow 1.x. To see the results of my trained model, go to object_detection folder and run 'object_detection_tutorial.ipynb' While the results were good on images of steel that had defects on it, sometimes random images from the internet also got labeled as steel patches 

I do intend to retrain the same dataset on retinanet using the focal loss method at a later time
